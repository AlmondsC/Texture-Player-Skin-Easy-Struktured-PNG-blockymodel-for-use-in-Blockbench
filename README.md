# Texture-Player-Skin-Easy-Struktured-PNG-blockymodel-for-use-in-Blockbench
Disclaimer! I don't own the design of the skin! This is still the work of Hytale's amazing artists! What I did: I merely expanded upon some missing areas and clarified the structure visually. With this, people can easily differentiate the right and left body areas and I changed the UV positions in the blockymodel
