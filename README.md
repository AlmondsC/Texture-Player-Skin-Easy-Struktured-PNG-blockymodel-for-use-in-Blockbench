Texture Player Skin | Easy Struktured | PNG & blockymodel | for use in Blockbench

Disclaimer!
I don't own the design of the skin! This is still the work of Hytale's amazing artists!

What I did:
I merely expanded upon some missing areas and clarified the structure visually. With this, people can easily differentiate the right and left body areas.
I changed the UV positions in the "ORIGINAL Hytale Folder .blockymodel" accordingly to fit my PNG skin texture version.

Additional Info!
This blockymodel file has already included the original anchor points for the attachments you can add. If you want to change the height of the eye position, this "blockymodel" has the anchor point that you need to move accordingly. Don't forget, in that case, to change the position of the eyes on your PNG as well.
Have fun <3
